	        </header><p>The standard weekly rate for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is £81.60 a week. It’s paid by your employer and can be paid for up to 28 weeks. </p> 
 
<p>Your employer will work out a daily rate of SSP if necessary. They will do this by dividing the weekly rate by the number of days you’d normally work in that week. For working out SSP, a week runs from Sunday to Saturday.</p> 
 
<p>You will be paid for the days that you would normally work for your employer – these are called your ‘qualifying days’. However, you <strong>won’t</strong> be paid for: </p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>the first 3 qualifying days – called ‘waiting days’ (even if you work part-time)</li> 
  <li>any days that you took as absence before telling your employer you were ill (in addition to the qualifying days)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you have a varied work pattern, your qualifying days may be different in each week that you work. </p> 
 
<h2 id="example-if-you-work-full-time">Example if you work full-time</h2> 
<p>If you work Monday to Friday and become ill on a Friday, your waiting days will be Friday, Monday and Tuesday. If you continue to be ill, SSP will be paid from Wednesday.</p> 
 
<h2 id="example-if-you-work-part-time">Example if you work part-time</h2> 
<p>If you work Thursdays and Fridays and become ill on a Friday, your waiting days will be the Friday of the week that you become ill and the Thursday and Friday of the next week. </p> 
 
<p>If you continue to be ill, SSP will be paid from the Thursday of the following week.</p> 
 
<h2 id="if-youve-been-ill-within-the-last-8-weeks">If you’ve been ill within the last 8 weeks</h2> 
<p>You might not have to wait 3 days to get SSP if you have received SSP within the last 8 weeks and have become ill again. If you are ill for at least 4 days in a row in the 2nd period, you won’t have to wait 3 days to receive SSP. </p>
