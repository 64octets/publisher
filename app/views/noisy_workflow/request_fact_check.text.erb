Hello,

The following piece of mainstream GOV.UK content is ready to be checked for factual accuracy:

Title: <%= @edition.title %>
<%= "#{Plek.current.find("publication-preview")}/#{@edition.slug}?edition=#{@edition.version_number}" %>

You will need your GOV.UK user name and password to view the content.

If you or your colleagues spot something that's factually incorrect please reply to this email with comments:

- directing us to any specific instances, e.g. part 2, subheading 3
- explaining what the problem is, e.g. the text implies a legal obligation, when there isn't one

Please don't rewrite the text - just point out any factual errors.  We will rewrite accordingly.

Please respond within ten working days.  If you may not be able to meet this deadline let us know as soon as possible.

PLEASE SEND COMMENTS TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS:
<%= @edition.fact_check_email_address %>
This will ensure they are logged in the right place in our system.

If you've forgotten your username and password, please email govuk-feedback@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk.

Many thanks,
GOV.UK editorial team
