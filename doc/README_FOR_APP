== In the absence of reliable local transaction data feeds ==

Here's how to do initial setup for the local transactions data:

* grab the .xls from http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/507390/localdirectgov/xls/1523569.xls
  and extract the second sheet to a CSV, named 'service_list.csv'
* grab the CSV (which currently claims to be a .xls) from http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/507390/localdirectgov/xls/1963339 
  and save it as council_name_to_snac.csv
* grab the CSV from http://local.direct.gov.uk/Data/local_authority_service_details.csv

run script/combine_lgd_data as follows:

./script/combine_lgd_data local_authority_service_details.csv service_list.csv council_name_to_snac.csv

This will create a file called 'local_transactions.csv'

open a Rails console and:

f = File.open('council_name_to_snac.csv', 'r:Windows-1252:UTF-8')
Authority.populate_from_source(f)

f = File.open('local_transactions.csv', 'r:Windows-1252:UTF-8')
LocalTransactionsSource.populate_from_source(f)

Be warned, that last step took a couple of hours on my machine.
